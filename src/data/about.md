I am a mathematician and software developer with a deep passion for the intersection of mathematics, physics, and technology. My academic journey has been shaped by a fascination with the beauty of mathematics, particularly the geometry and topology of higher-dimensional spaces. This passion led me to specialize in differential topology during my studies at Humboldt University of Berlin, where I recently completed my **bachelor’s thesis** on Seiberg-Witten theory and the Differential Topology of 4-manifolds. You can find it [here](https://grapentt.github.io/personal-website/thesis.pdf).

Alongside my academic pursuits, I have gained extensive experience in software development, integrating theoretical insights with practical implementation. My expertise spans backend and frontend development, with a strong foundation in **Java, Python and React**, as well as **data science and mathematical optimization**. I have applied these skills across various industries, from **aerospace consulting at KPMG** to **enterprise software development at SAP**, where I contribute to building composable process platforms.

Beyond my corporate experience, I have worked as a **freelance developer**, where I developed **a software solution for the vehicle routing problem**. As part of this project, I built a **Route Optimization Visualizer**, a website that demonstrates key algorithms for solving routing problems. You can explore it [here](https://grapentt.github.io/RouteOptimizationVisualizer/).

I am always looking for opportunities to combine my passion for **mathematics and coding**—whether through research, software development, or innovative problem-solving at the intersection of theory and application.
