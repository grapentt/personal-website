I am a highly curious student of Computer Science, Math, and Physics with a deep
interest in Differential Geometry/Topology. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have a strong background in full-stack development and data science.

I recently finished my bachelor thesis. You can find it here: https://grapentt.github.io/personal-website/thesis.pdf

I am seeking to combine my passion for math and coding.
